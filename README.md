## My process

I first started by reviewing all sections and elements in Figma, then wrote the main CSS file which contains the main fonts and colors defined in Figma then I started to write the main section of the page in HTML and CSS and make it responsive and then started with the logic for the calculator in JavaScript, then I continued with the rest of the page sections.
